# Towards a Consortium for a Robotic Software Stack :blush:



## Mission statement and application domains

The goal of the Maestro Consortium is to construct and maintain a robotics software stack focused on motion and manipulation tasks, and keep the ecosystem around it thriving. The consortium’s software stack has both research and industrial significance.

## Open source and common goods

All the software components currently envisioned in the Consortium have been and are currently developed by French research institutes (namely Inria and CNRS) under permissive Open Source Software licenses (mostly BSD).

## Consortium Foundations

The Consortium’s software stack encompass software developed over the years by Inria and CNRS, with significant effort (and thus funding) for both research activities (thru scientists, post-docs and PhDs) and engineering activities (thru engineers and experimental platforms).

## Consortium Organization

The consortium operates as a collaborative action between academic and industrial partners, governed by a Consortium Agreement that outlines its rules and procedures. The Consortium is therefore not a legal entity by itself.
